# Sum of subset differences
## Easy 
<div class="problem-statement">
                <p></p><p><span style="font-size:20px">Given an array S consisting of n numbers, find the sum of difference between last and first element of each subset.<br>
For example for set 5,8 there are 3 subsets possible<br>
5 &nbsp; &nbsp;(difference is 5-5 = 0 as 5 is the only last and first element)<br>
8 &nbsp; &nbsp;(difference is 8-8 = 0 as 8&nbsp;is the only last and first element)<br>
5 8 (difference is 8-5 = 3 as 8&nbsp;is the last element &nbsp;and 5 is the first element)<br>
thus difference sum is 0+0+3 = 3<br>
You are required to complete the function which returns an integer denoting the sum of difference between last and first element for each subset of array S.<br>
<br>
Note:&nbsp;Elements in the subset should be in the same order as in the set S.<br>
<br>
<strong>Input:</strong><br>
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains 2 lines the first line of input contains an integer N denoting the size of the array A. In the next line are N space separated values of the array A.<br>
<br>
<strong>Output:</strong><br>
For each test case in a new line output will be the sum of difference between last and first element of each subset of array S.<br>
<br>
<strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
1&lt;=T&lt;=100<br>
1&lt;=N&lt;=20<br>
1&lt;=A[]&lt;=1000<br>
<br>
<strong>Example(To be used only for expected output) :<br>
Input:</strong><br>
2<br>
4<br>
5 2 9 6<br>
3<br>
1 2 3&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
21<br>
6<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong>The <strong>Input/Ouput</strong> format and <strong>Example</strong> given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for <strong>Expected Output</strong> only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.</span></p>
